* Objectives

This course introduces the theory and practice of computer
networks. We cover topics such as software protocols, communication
hardware, error detection, error handling, and basic network
programming. The course focuses on building a solid foundation in
networking concepts while offering practical programming assignments
to apply the learned concepts.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete CSC 410 "Data Communications & Networks" will be able to:
- Understand the OSI and TCP/IP models and their layers.
- Explain network protocols, addressing, and error handling.
- Demonstrate knowledge of communication hardware components.
- Write and debug basic network applications using sockets.
- Apply error detection and correction techniques.
- Gain familiarity with network configuration and security.

* Course Requirements / Prerequisites

- Prerequisite courses: CSC 265 (Algorithms) and CSC 310 (Operating
  Systems), or permission of the instructor/advisor.
- Basic programming knowledge in C/C++.
- Familiarity with command-line tools.
- Curiosity and willingness to explore practical networking tasks.

* Grading System

You should be able to see your current grade at any time using the
Canvas gradebook for the course.

| WHEN    | DESCRIPTION           | IMPACT |
|---------+-----------------------+--------|
| Weekly  | Assignments           |    25% |
| Weekly  | Multiple choice tests |    25% |
| Monthly | Project Sprint review |    25% |
| TBD     | Final exam (optional) |    25% |

Notes:
- *To pass:* 60% of all available points.
- *Tests:* weekly online quizzes based on classroom lectures and
  practice.
- *Final exam:* random selection of the known test questions. *Note:* You
  only have to write the final exam if you want to improve your grade
  at the end of the course. If the final exam result is below your
  final grade average up to this point, it will be ignored.
