* DONE Installing Cisco Packet Tracer

  1) Login to Linux and downnload the software [[https://www.netacad.com/resources/lab-downloads?courseLang=en-US][from here]]

  2) Make a local directory:
     #+begin_example sh
     mkdir -p ~/packettracer
     #+end_example

  3) Change to the download directory and unpack the =.deb= file into
     the directory you just created:
     #+begin_example
     dpkg-deb -x Packet_Tracer822_amd64_signed.deb ~/packettracer
     #+end_example

  4) Make a safe copy of =~/packettracer/opt/pt/packettracer=:
     #+begin_example
     cd ~/packettracer/opt/pt
     cp -v packettracer packettracer.sav
     #+end_example

  5) Edit the =packettracer= script as follows:
     #+begin_example sh
     #!/bin/bash

     echo Starting Packet Tracer 8.2.2

     PTDIR="$HOME/packettracer/opt/pt"
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PTDIR/bin"
     pushd $PTDIR/bin > /dev/null
     ./PacketTracer "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1
     popd > /dev/null
     #+end_example

  6) Make a symlink from the script to =pt= in your home directory:
     #+begin_example sh
     cd ~
     ln -s ~/packettracer/opt/pt/packettracer ~/pt
     #+end_example

  7) Start Packet Tracer:
     #+begin_example sh
     ./pt
     #+end_example

* Getting started with Cisco Packet Tracer

  Packet tracer file: 11_Packet_Tracer_Demo.pkt

  We select two hosts, connect them (1-6) and configure them so that
  they can talk to each other with MAC and IP addresses (7-11), which
  we can verify and simulate in Cisco packet tracer (12-18). Finally,
  we configure the simulation event list for our purposes.

  1) *Setup*: Go to =[End Devices]= and select a =Server= - the selection is
     blocked until you click in the =Logical= canvas where now a
     =Server-PT Server0= will appear.

  2) Do the same thing with a PC to create a =PC-PT PC0=.

  3) Click on either of them to see different menus:
     - Physical description (image of the plugin points and racks)
     - Config (network settings)
     - Services (what the device can do)
     - Desktop (runs services)
     - Programming (scripts in a Cisco-specific config language)
     - Attributes (serial no, price, power, size, wattage)

  4) "Logical" = Symbolic model or network diagram to represent a
     physical network. Symbols are variable. Another example:
     [[https://gns3.com][gns3.com]]. You can customize the representing symbol in the
     =Physical= menu of an =end device=.

  5) These two devices cannot communicate with one another. We can
     connect them using physical cables or air connections
     (wifi). Choose =[Connections]= and select a =Copper Cross-Over=
     cable. The mouse pointer symbol changes.

     [[../img/cross-over-cable.png]]

     You can now try a few cables: For some of them, a connection is
     possible but the link will appear red (no link), or the cable
     cannot be connected to the available ports at all.

  6) Connect the =Cross-over Cable= at the =PC= and at the =Server= to the
     =Fast Ethernet= port. Your network should look like this, and the
     link is up (green):

     #+attr_html: :width 300px:
     #+caption: Image: Cisco Packet Tracer
     [[../img/pc_server.png]]

  7) To establish a connection, we need a MAC (Media Access Control)
     address (hard-wired into the networking card by the
     manufacturer). MAC addresses are unique.

     For both PC and Server, go to =Config > FastEthernet0= to find the
     =MAC Address= of the device. Examples:
     - PC: =0001.637A.0AD2=
     - Server: =00E0.B086.EB03=

  8) Exercise: Find the MAC address of

     1. Your mobile phone: About Phone > Status information > Phone
        Wi-Fi MAC address

     2. Your Windows PC: Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network
        Connections > WiFi Details > Physical Address

  9) MAC addresses are 12-digit number (in hexadecimal). Change the
     server MAC address to: 0001.2222.2222, and PC: 0001.1111.1111.

  10) You also need an IP (Internet Protocol) address: This address
      comes in one of two formats, IPv4 or IPv6, and it is allocated by
      the DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.

      We'll talk about the formats of these addresses later!

      *Exercise:*
      1. Open a shell on Windows (CMD), or on Linux/MacOS (Unix), and
         enter =ipconfig= (Windows) or =netstat -nt= (Unix). On Windows, you
         see =IPv4 Address=, on Linux you get a list of "Active Internet
         connections", e.g.
         #+begin_example
         Proto Local Address           Foreign Address         State
         tcp   192.168.1.250:36372     52.22.110.116:443       ESTABLISHED
         tcp   192.168.1.250:56756     104.244.42.193:443      ESTABLISHED
         #+end_example

         Windows:
         #+attr_html: :width 600px:
         [[../img/ipconfig.png]]

      2. On an Android mobile phone: Settings > About phone > Status
         information > IP address
         #+begin_example
         fe80:ac4b:fdff:fe96:3680
         192.168.68.50
         #+end_example

  11) In our network, we don't have a DHCP server so we must configure
      the IP addresses manually: Open the =Config= menu for the devices,
      and enter =Static= values for the =FastEthernet0= =IP Configuration=:

      1. PC: IP Address: =10.1.1.1=, Subnet Mask: =255.255.255.0=
      2. Server: IP Address: =10.1.1.2=, Subnet Mask: =255.255.255.0=

      Check this using the =ipconfig= command in the =Desktop= menu by
      selecting =Command Prompt= which brings up a terminal connected to
      the PC or server:
      #+attr_html: :width 400px:
      [[../img/ipconfig.png]]

  12) Go back to the PC's =Command Prompt= and =ping= the server (if you
      find that the font of the CLI is too small, change it in =Options= >
      =Preferences= > =Font= > =CLI=):
      #+attr_html: :width 400px:
      [[../img/ping.png]]

  13) Look at the services running on the server by switching to the
      =Services= tab of the =Server0=:

      1. HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol

      2. DNS - Domain Name Service

      3. EMAIL

      4. FTP - File Transfer Protocol

      5. IoT - Internet of Things

  14) Leave =HTTP= in the =On= position, then switch to the PC and open
      =Desktop= > =Web Browser=, enter the URL =http://10.1.1.2= of the
      server, and click =Go=. A web page appears, which, alongside with
      its sub-pages, is served by the server.
      #+attr_html: :width 400px:
      [[../img/url.png]]

  15) Go back to the server's =Services= menu and turn =HTTP= to =Off= but
      leave =HTTPS= in the =On= position: Now, only =https= connections
      (secure, encrypted version of HTTP) are being served.

      Your service attempt might time out or the server might reset the
      connection but you won't get a page until you change to =https=.

  16) To see how a packet travels across the network, Open the PC's web
      browser and activate it while viewing the network image, with the
      main windows switched to =Simulation= instead of =Realtime=.
      #+attr_html: :width 600px:
      [[../img/simulation.png]]

      In the network diagram you can see the packet traveling, and in
      the =Event list= of the =Simulation Panel=, you can see how a packet
      travels from =PC0= to =Server0= and back, and how the PC is listening
      for =HTTP= service requests.

  17) If you click on the first =PC0= in the =Event list= before the packet
      is being sent, you see a snapshot of different network layers that
      are being triggered (and can be traversed there, too).
      #+attr_html: :width 400px:
      [[../img/pc0_layers.png]]

      You can see how some the information we entered is used:

      1. The cable connection on the /physical/ layer 1: =FastEthernet0=.

      2. The corresponding MAC addresses in the /data link/ layer 2.

      3. The source and destination IP addresses in the /network/ layer 3.

      4. Set: the source and destination ports in the /transport/ layer.

  18) You can also select "Outbound PDU Details" (PDU stands for
      Protocol Data Unit) which provides even more detail and in
      particular, how the header information (meta information for the
      transport) is distributed in memory.

  19) Configure the =Event List= of the =Simulation= panel: Click on =Show
      All/None= to see all (or none) of the available service
      events. Choose =Edit Filters= and check only those ACL (Access
      Control List) filters relevant. E.g. =ICMP= (Internet Control
      Message Protocol) for the =ping= command.

  20) Run the web service again as before with all filters unselected,
      and you should only see =TCP= and =HTTP=.
