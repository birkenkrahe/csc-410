* Overview

- We implemented a simple TCP server that served a web page with HTTP.

- We will now implement a TCP client that can establish an IPv4
  connection with any listening TCP server.

- Topics:
  1. [ ] Configuring a remote address with ~getaddrinfo~
  2. [ ] Initiating a TCP connection with ~connect~
  3. [ ] Detecting terminal input in a non-blocking manner
  4. [ ] Multiplexing with ~fork~
  5. [ ] Multiplexing with ~select~
  6. [ ] Detecting peer disconnects
  7. [ ] Implementing a basic microservice
  8. [ ] The stream-like nature of TCP
  9. [ ] The blocking behavior of ~send~

* Header files

- We use the same header files as before when networking the
  time-telling program, and we're tangling to =tcp.h=

  #+begin_src C :tangle tcp.h :main no :includes :results none
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <sys/socket.h>
    #include <netinet/in.h>
    #include <arpa/inet.h>
    #include <netdb.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <errno.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <time.h>
    #include <string.h>
  #+end_src

* Multiplexing connections (multiple clients, multiple services)

- The socket APIs are blocking by default: When ~accept~ runs to wait
  for a connection, the program is on hold until it becomes
  available. When you use ~recv~, the program blocks until new data is
  available.

- If you only have one client (like for =time_server.c=), blocking is no
  problem but if you have multiple clients, it is. Any other clients
  that tried to connect while one is being served, have to wait.

- You cannot have blocking on the server side if you want to serve
  multiple clients. Serving one client at a time is not going to work.

- You cannot have blocking on the client side if you want to download
  multiple resources (e.g. images, scripts, etc.) in parallel.

- The solution to this is to start a new process for each connection
  so that blocking sockets don't block other processes.

* Forking processes

- On Unix-based systems, starting a new process is easy using the ~fork~
  function to create a child process. Each child process has its own
  memory space, and each client is handled in a separate process.

- From ~man fork(2)~: Returns a unique new process ID (PID).
  #+begin_example C
  pid_t fork(void);
  #+end_example

- Here is how it works:
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes :results output
    #include <stdio.h>  // for input/output
    #include <unistd.h> // to close sockets
    #include <errno.h>  // perror and errno

    int main(void)
    {
      pid_t pid = fork(); // create a new process

      if (pid == 0) { //
        // child process
        printf("Hello from child (PID: %d)\n", getpid());
      } else if (pid > 0) {
        // parent process
        printf("Hello from parent (PID: %d, child PID: %d)\n", getpid(), pid);
      } else {
        // fork failed
        perror("fork failed");
      }
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Hello from parent (PID: 1239813, child PID: 1239814)
  : Hello from child (PID: 1239814)

- ~fork~ returns 0 in the child process, and a positive number (child's
  PID) in the parent process, and -1 if the fork fails.

- You can create a *fork bomb* if you're not careful by forking in an
  infinite loop. If you try this, you should set a process limit first
  with ~ulimit -u 100~.

- Check the current limit:
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    ulimit -u
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 255424

- Similar to process forking is *multithreading*: here, a new thread
  within the same process is created using ~pthread_createe(3)~. Threads
  share the same address space - more scalable for large number of
  connections.

- To learn more about this, take the Operating Systems course (CSC
  420) where we talk about process management.

* Practice: Creating a Fork Bomb (Safely)

Why? To understand how uncontrolled process creation can overload a
system, and learn how to limit and observe system behavior.

1. Create the fork bomb program: Tangle it and build it with ~make~:
   #+begin_src c :tangle fork_bomb.c
     #include <stdio.h>
     #include <unistd.h>

     int main() {
       while (1) {
         pid_t pid = fork();
         if (pid < 0) {
           perror("fork failed");
           break;
         }
       }
       return 0;
     }
   #+end_src

2. In a terminal:
   1) Check the current number of permitted concurrent processes
   2) Reset the limit to 100
   3) Check again to make sure
   4) Build ~fork_bomb~
   5) Run ~fork_bomb~ - after a bit, send an interrupt signal (C-c C-c)
   6) Try any command on that shell, e.g. =ls=
   #+begin_src bash :results output
     ulimit -u  # before limiting the process number
     ulimit -u 100  # lower limit of allowed processes
     ulimit -u  # check again
     make fork_bomb # build fork bomb
     ./fork_bomb  # run fork bomb - interrupt process with C-c C-c
     ls # this should fail
   #+end_src

3. Observe the output:

   - You should see:
     *fork failed: Resource temporarily unavailable*
   - While =fork_bomb= is running, you can use ~ps~ or ~htop~ in another
     terminal to inspect child processes with =ps aux | grep
     fork_bomb=.
   - To see the parent PID:
     #+begin_example bash
     ps -eo pid,ppid,cmd | grep fork_bomb
     #+end_example
   - Clean up using:
     #+begin_src bash
       pkill -P <parent_pid>  # for example 991934
     #+end_src
     or kill/restart the shell session.

** Safety Notes

- Always use ~ulimit -u~ before running this kind of experiment.
- Never run fork bombs on shared or production systems.
- This exercise is for educational purposes only.

** Submission

- Upload the screenshot from the shell with the =fork failed....=
  printout or the screenshot that shows the child processes. Example:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
  [[../img/fork_bomb.png]]

* Forking TCP processes on Unix and Windows

- A multi-process TCP server may accept connections like this:
  #+begin_src C
    while (1) {
      socket_client = accept(socket_listen,
                         &new_client, &new_client_length);
      int pid = fork();
      if (pid == 0) { // child process only serves one connection
        close(socket_listen); // no need to listen here any longer
        recv(socket_client, ...); // receive stuff
        send(socket_client, ...); // send stuff
        close(socket_client); // child process closes socket copy
        exit(0); // exit gracefully
      }
      // parent process
      close(socket_client); // parent process closes socket
     }
  #+end_src

- When you call ~fork~, the child inherits copies of all open file
  descriptors/sockets but each process is independent. So the socket
  has to be closed in *both* processes.

- The child does not ~accept~ new connections but only receives and
  sends data, so it can =close(socket_listen)=.

- Overview:
  | Process | Socket FD     | Why we close it            |
  |---------+---------------+----------------------------|
  | Parent  | socket_client | Child handles it           |
  | Child   | socket_listen | Not accepting anymore      |
  | Child   | socket_client | Done talking to the client |

- Using multiple processes or threads in Windows is much more
  complicated. The OS uses multiple system functions.

- Debugging multi-process/thread programs is much more complicated
  than single process programs, and managing the shared state and the
  socket communication is harder, too.

-

* Multiplexing with ~select~

- We can give ~select(2)~ a set of sockets, and it tells us which ones
  are ready to be read, which sockets are ready to write to, and which
  sockets have exceptions.

- ~select~ is supported on Unix and Windows so it keeps our programs
  portable.

- The C function prototype (see ~man select~):
  #+begin_example C
  int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds,
             fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout);
  #+end_example

- Prototype analysis:
  #+begin_quote
  - Monitors multiple file descriptors for I/O readiness (read, write,
    exceptions).
  - Parameters:
    + ~nfds~: Highest file descriptor number + 1.
    + ~readfds~: File descriptors to check for readability (NULL if not needed).
    + ~writefds~: File descriptors to check for writability (NULL if not needed).
    + ~exceptfds~: File descriptors to check for exceptions (NULL if not needed).
    + ~timeout~: ~struct timeval~ for blocking duration (NULL for
      indefinite, 0 for non-blocking).
  - Return value:
    - Positive: Number of ready file descriptors.
    - =0=: Timeout expired.
    - =-1=: Error (check ~errno~).
    - fd_set Macros:
      + ~FD_ZERO~: Clear set.
      + ~FD_SET~: Add descriptor.
      + ~FD_CLR~: Remove descriptor.
      + ~FD_ISSET~: Check if descriptor is ready.
    - Notes:
      + Blocks until descriptors are ready, timeout, or signal interrupt.
      + Limited by ~FD_SETSIZE~ (typically 1024).
      + Alternatives: ~poll~, ~epoll~, ~kqueue~.
  #+end_quote

- Before calling ~select~, we have to add our sockets in an ~fd_set~. If
  we have three sockets =socket_listen=, =socket_a= and =socket_b=:

  #+begin_example C
      fd_set our_sockets; // declare socket set
      FD_ZERO(&our sockets); // zeroing out (emptying) the set
      FD_SET(socket_listen, &our_sockets);
      FD_SET(socket_a, &our_sockets);
      FD_SET(socket_b, &our_sockets);
  #+end_example

- ~fd_set~ is a bit array or bit mask where each bit represents a file
  descriptor, manipulated with macro commands. It's okay for a small
  set, and it's not dynamic (doesn't grow/shrink as needed).

- To remove a socket, you can use the ~FD_CLR~ macro, and to check for
  the presence of a socket, use ~FD_ISSET~.

- ~select~ requires that we pass a number that's large than the largest
  socket descriptor we are going to monitor:
  #+begin_example C
  int max_socket;
  max_socket = socket_listen;
  if (socket_a > max_socket) max_socket = socket_a;
  if (socket_b > max_socket) max_socket = socket_b;
  #+end_example

- When we call ~select~, it will modify =fd_set= - so we want to copy our
  socket set before calling it.
  #+begin_example C
  fd_set copy; // declare copy
  copy = our_sockets; // copy our socket set
  #+end_example

- This call checks the =copy= until at least one of the sockets in the
  list is ready to be read from.
  #+begin_example C
  // args: highest socket no + 1, copy of set
  select(max_socket + 1, &copy, 0, 0, 0);
  #+end_example

- To check which sockets are still in =copy=, use ~FD_ISSET~:
  #+begin_example C
  if (FD_ISSET(socket_list, &copy)) {
     // socket_listen has a new connection - accept
     accept(socket_listen, ...)
  }
  if (FD_ISSET(socket_a, &copy)) {
     // socket_a is ready to be read from - receive
     recv(socket_a, ...)
  }
  if (FD_ISSET(socket_list, &copy)) {
     // socket_b is ready to be read from - receive
     recv(socket_b, ...)
  }
  #+end_example

- Similarly, to check for *writeability* (~send~) instead of *readability*
  (~recv~), we would use the third argument for =copy=. When we monitor a
  set of sockets for exceptional conditions (special data,
  e.g. "urgent" data, like an interrupt signal for the ~telnet~ protocol
  = complete remote terminal access).

* Timeout

- The last argument of ~select~ allows us to specify a timeout:
  #+begin_example C
  struct timeval {
     long tv_sec;   // number of seconds
     long tv_usec;  // number of microseconds
  }
  #+end_example

- Example: To wait a maximum of 1.5 seconds
  #+begin_example C
  struct timeval timeout; // create a timeout object
  timeout.tv_sec = 1;
  timeout.tv_usec = 500000 // 5 seconds = 500 milli sec = 500,000 micro secs

  // select returns after a socket in fd_set copy is ready or after 1.5 secs
  select(max_socket + 1, &copy, 0, 0, &timeout);
  #+end_example

- If =timeout.tv_sec = timeout.tv_usec = 0=, then ~select~ returns
  immediately. If we pass a ~NULL~ pointer, it does not return until at
  least one socket is ready to be read.

* Monitoring sockets

- To monitor for writeable sockets on which we could call ~send~ without
  blocking, you can check for all three conditions with one call:
  #+begin_example C
  select(max_socket + 1, &ready_to_read, &ready_to_write, &excepted, &timeout);
  #+end_example

- On success, ~select~ returns the number of socket descriptors
  contained in the up to three descriptor sets it monitors. If it
  timed out before any sockets were readable/writeable/excepted, it
  returns -1 to indicate an error.

* Practice: Multiplexing with ~select~ using ~stdin~

- Goal: Introduce the concept of using ~select()~ to monitor a file descriptor
  (stdin) for input readiness, with a timeout.

- Instructions:
  1. Type the following C program that monitors ~stdin~ (file
     descriptor 0) for up to 5 seconds.
  2. Run the program and either type something quickly or wait for the
     timeout.
  3. Observe how ~select()~ behaves.

*-* Source Code: Tangle the file =select_stdin.c=
#+begin_src C :tangle select_stdin.c :main no :includes :results none
  #include <stdio.h>        // for printf, perror, fgets
  #include <unistd.h>       // for read, STDIN_FILENO
  #include <sys/select.h>   // for select(), fd_set, timeval

  int main() {
    fd_set readfds;               // fd_set is a set of file descriptors (bitmask)
    struct timeval timeout;       // timeval defines the timeout for select()

    // Step 1: Initialize the file descriptor set
    FD_ZERO(&readfds);            // Always clear the set before using
    FD_SET(0, &readfds);          // Add stdin (file descriptor 0) to the set

    // Step 2: Set the timeout for select()
    timeout.tv_sec = 5;           // Wait for up to 5 seconds
    timeout.tv_usec = 0;          // and 0 microseconds

    printf("Waiting for input on stdin (5 sec timeout)...\n");

    // Step 3: Call select()
    // Parameters:
    // - 1: max file descriptor + 1 (stdin is 0, so we pass 1)
    // - &readfds: watch for readability on stdin
    // - NULL: not checking for writability
    // - NULL: not checking for exceptions
    // - &timeout: how long to wait
    int ret = select(1, &readfds, NULL, NULL, &timeout);

    // Step 4: Handle the result
    if (ret == -1) {
      // select() returned an error
      perror("select() error");
    } else if (ret == 0) {
      // Timeout occurred, no file descriptors were ready
      printf("Timeout. No input.\n");
    } else {
      // At least one file descriptor is ready — check which
      if (FD_ISSET(0, &readfds)) {
        // stdin is ready for reading
        char buffer[100];
        fgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin);  // Read input from user
        printf("You typed: %s\n", buffer);     // Print what the user typed
      }
    }

    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

- Expected Behavior
  + If you type something within 5 seconds, it prints what you typed.
  + If you wait more than 5 seconds, it prints a timeout message.
  + If an error occurs (e.g., interrupted by a signal), it prints the
    error using ~perror("select")~. For this to work e.g. with C-c, you
    need to install a signal handler (returns to ~perror~ to print).

- ~make~ the executable and test it in a terminal (not in an .org file):
  #+begin_example bash
   make select_stdin
   ./select_stdin
  #+end_example

- *Extension questions:*

  + What would happen if you set ~timeout.tv_sec = 0~ and
    ~timeout.tv_usec = 0~?
    #+begin_quote
    The call would become non-blocking - it would return immediately,
    indicating which sockets are ready at that moment.
    #+end_quote
  + How would you modify the program to also monitor a socket
    =socket_fd=?
    #+begin_quote
    Add =socket_fd= to =fd_set= using =FD_SET(socket_fd, &readfds)=, and
    update the first argument to ~select~ to be the highest socket + 1:
    =select(max(fd_stdin, socket_fd) + 1, ...)=.
    #+end_quote
  + What other events could you watch for using the ~writefds~ and
    ~exceptfds~ arguments?
    #+begin_quote
    ~writefds~ - which sockets are ready to send data to without
    blocking, and ~exceptfds~ - detect exceptional conditions, which may
    indicate urgent messages or errors.
    #+end_quote


* Building a TCP client that can connect to any TCP server

- This TCP client will take a hostname (or IP address) and port number
  from the command line.

- It will attempt a connection to the TCP server at that address.

- If successful, it will relay data that's received from that server
  to the terminal, and data inputted into the terminal to the server.

- It will continue until either is terminated with C-c or the server
  closes the connection.

- Program flow:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
  [[../img/tcp_client.png]]

- We resolve the server address from the command-line arguments with
  ~getaddrinfo~. We create the socket with ~socket~, and ~connect~ it to the
  server. We monitor for keyboard input with ~select~. If there's input,
  we send it over the socket with ~send~. If ~select~ says that socket
  data is available, we read it with ~recv~ and ~printf~ it. The ~select~
  loop is repeated until the socket is closed.

* Source code
** Main program with header file and code chunks
#+begin_src C :main no :includes :tangle tcp_client.c :noweb yes
  #include "tcp.h"
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])
  {
    <<check command-line arguments>>
    <<configure remote address to connect>>
    <<print remote address>>
    <<create socket>>
    <<connect to remote server>>
    <<monitor new data>>
    <<close socket>>
    return 0;
  }
#+end_src

** Check if command-line arguments were given

- Code:
  #+name: check command-line arguments
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes :results none
    if (argc < 3) {
      fprintf(stderr, "usage: tcp_client hostname port\n");
      return 1;
     }
  #+end_src

- Code Explanation: Command-Line Argument Check
  + Checks if enough command-line arguments are provided.
  + ~argc < 3~: Tests if fewer than 3 arguments (program name + 2 args)
    are passed.
    - ~argc~: Number of arguments (includes program name, e.g.,
      ~./tcp_client~).
    - Minimum 3 required: program name, hostname, port.
  + ~fprintf(stderr, "usage: tcp_client hostname port\n")~:
    - Prints usage message to standard error if check fails.
    - Informs user to provide hostname and port (e.g., ~./tcp_client
      example.com 8080~).
  + ~return 1~: Exits program with error code 1 (indicating failure).
  + Purpose: Ensures user provides required inputs for TCP client
    (hostname and port).

** Use input to configure a remote address

- Code:
  #+name: configure remote address to connect
  #+begin_src C :main no :includes :results none
    printf("Configuring remote address...\n");
    struct addrinfo hints;
    memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints)); // zero out the struct
    hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM; // request TCP socket

    // point to linked list of addrinfo structs
    struct addrinfo *peer_address;

    // perform name resolution host + port
    if (getaddrinfo(argv[1], argv[2], &hints, &peer_address)) {
      // return non-zero on error
      fprintf(stderr, "getaddrinfo() failed. (%d)\n", errno);
      return 1;
     }
  #+end_src

- Explanation:
  + Prints: "Configuring remote address..." to indicate start of
    address setup.
  + ~struct addrinfo hints~: Defines criteria for address resolution.
  + ~memset(&hints, 0, sizeof(hints))~: Clears ~hints~ structure to avoid
    garbage values.
  + ~hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM~: Specifies TCP socket
    (stream-based).
  + ~struct addrinfo *peer_address~: Pointer to linked list of address
    results.
  + ~getaddrinfo(argv[1], argv[2], &hints, &peer_address)~:
    - Resolves hostname (~argv[1]~, e.g., "example.com") and port
      (~argv[2]~, e.g., "8080") to socket addresses.
    - Uses ~hints~ to filter results (TCP only).
    - Stores results in ~peer_address~.
  + Error handling:
    - Non-zero return from ~getaddrinfo~ indicates failure.
    - Prints error to ~stderr~ with ~errno~.
    - Exits with ~return 1~ (error status).
  + Purpose: Prepares remote server address for TCP client connection.

- Notice the difference to the time-telling program:
  1) Then, we wanted to configure a *local* address, this time, we want
     to configure a *remote* address.
  2) We don't need to seet =hints.ai_family= here because ~getaddrinfo~
     can decide if IPv4 or IPv6 is the appropriate protocol.
  3) Hostname and port are passed directly to ~getaddrinfo~, and if
     everything goes well, our remote address is in =peer_address=.

** Print remote address after configuration

- We don't need to do this but it's a good debugging measure.

- The function ~getnameinfo(3)~ converts the remote address back into a
  string for printout:
  #+name: print remote address
  #+begin_src C
    printf("Remote address is: ");
    char address_buffer[100];
    char service_buffer[100];

    getnameinfo(peer_address->ai_addr,
                peer_address->ai_addrlen,
                address_buffer, sizeof(address_buffer),
                service_buffer, sizeof(service_buffer),
                NI_NUMERICHOST);
    printf("%s %s\n", address_buffer, service_buffer);
  #+end_src

- Explanation:
  + Prints remote peer’s IP address and port as strings.
  + ~address_buffer[100]~: Stores numeric IP (e.g., "192.168.1.1").
  + ~service_buffer[100]~: Stores port number (e.g., "8080").
  + ~getnameinfo~:
    - Converts ~peer_address->ai_addr~ (socket address) to strings.
    - ~NI_NUMERICHOST~: Returns numeric IP, not hostname.
    - Fills ~address_buffer~ (IP) and ~service_buffer~ (port).
  + ~printf("%s %s\n", address_buffer, service_buffer)~: Outputs IP and port.
  + Example output: "Remote address is: 192.168.1.1 8080".

** Create socket on client side

- We can now create our socket using ~socket(2)~:
  #+name: create socket
  #+begin_src C
    printf("Creating socket...\n");
    int socket_peer;
    socket_peer = socket(peer_address->ai_family,
                     peer_address->ai_socktype,
                     peer_address->ai_protocol);
    if (!(socket_peer > 0)) {
      fprintf(stderr, "socket() failed. (%d)\n", errno);
      return 1;
     }
  #+end_src

- Code Explanation:
  + ~int socket_peer~: Variable to store the socket file descriptor.
  + ~socket(peer_address->ai_family, peer_address->ai_socktype,
    peer_address->ai_protocol)~:
    - Creates a new socket using parameters from ~peer_address~ (from
      ~getaddrinfo~).
    - ~ai_family~: Address family (e.g., ~AF_INET~ for IPv4, ~AF_INET6~ for
      IPv6).
    - ~ai_socktype~: Socket type (e.g., ~SOCK_STREAM~ for TCP).
    - ~ai_protocol~: Protocol (e.g., ~IPPROTO_TCP~ for TCP).
  + Error handling:
    - Checks ~!(socket_peer > 0)~: Ensures socket creation succeeded
      (valid file descriptor > 0).
    - On failure, prints error to ~stderr~ with ~errno~ (system error
      code).
    - Exits with ~return 1~ (error status).
  + Purpose: Creates a TCP socket for connecting to a remote server.

** Establish connection to remote server

- After the socket has been created, we call ~connect(2)~ to establish a
connection to the remote server:
#+name: connect to remote server
#+begin_src C
  printf("Connecting...\n");
  if (connect(socket_peer,
            peer_address->ai_addr,
            peer_address->ai_addrlen)) {
    fprintf(stderr, "connect() failed. (%d)\n", errno);
    return 1;
   }

  freeaddrinfo(peer_address);

  printf("Connected.\n");
  printf("To send data, enter text followed by enter.\n");
#+end_src

- Explanation:
  + ~connect(socket_peer, peer_address->ai_addr,
    peer_address->ai_addrlen)~:
    - Initiates a TCP connection to the remote server.
    - ~socket_peer~: Socket file descriptor (from ~socket()~).
    - ~peer_address->ai_addr~: Remote server address (from
      ~getaddrinfo()~).
    - ~peer_address->ai_addrlen~: Length of the address structure.
  + Error handling:
    - Non-zero return from ~connect()~ indicates failure.
    - Prints error to ~stderr~ with ~errno~ (system error code, e.g.,
      connection refused).
    - Exits with ~return 1~ (error status).
  + ~freeaddrinfo(peer_address)~:
    - Frees memory allocated by ~getaddrinfo()~ for ~peer_address~.
    - Prevents memory leaks after the address is used.
  + Purpose: Establishes a TCP connection to the server and cleans
    up.

- Note: This is very similar to ~bind~ in the networking the
  time-telling program. Instead of associating a socket with a local
  address, ~connect~ associates a socket with a remote address and
  initiates a TCP connection.

** Loop while checking for new data

- The TCP connection has now been established to the remote server.

- The program needs to loop while checking both the terminal and the
  socket for new data. Terminal data are sent over the socket, and
  data read from the socket is printed out to the terminal.

- We cannot use ~recv(2)~ directly because it would block the connection
  until data comes from the socket, and terminal input is ignored.

- Instead, we're now bringing in ~select(2)~ to monitor for input using
  the file descriptor set:
  #+name: monitor new data
  #+begin_src C
    while(1) {

      fd_set reads; // stores socket set
      FD_ZERO(&reads); // zero the set
      FD_SET(socket_peer, &reads); // add our socket
      FD_SET(0, &reads); // add terminal 
      
      struct timeval timeout; // check for socket activity
      timeout.tv_sec = 0;
      timeout.tv_usec = 100000; // timeout after 100 milliseconds
      if (select(socket_peer + 1, &reads, 0, 0,&timeout) < 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "select() failed. (%d)\n", errno);
        return 1;
      }

      if (FD_ISSET(socket_peer, &reads)) { // read socket data
        char read[4096];
        int bytes_received = recv(socket_peer, read, 4096, 0);
        if (bytes_received < 1) {
          printf("Connection closed by peer.\n");
          break;
        }
        printf("Received (%d bytes): %.*s\n",
                   bytes_received, bytes_received, read);
      }

      if (FD_ISSET(0, &reads)) { // check terminal input (stdin 0)
        char read[4096];
        if (!fgets(read, 4096, stdin)) break;
        printf("Sending: %s", read);
        int bytes_sent = send(socket_peer, read, strlen(read), 0);
        printf("Sent %d bytes.\n", bytes_sent);
      }
     }
  #+end_src

  - Errors on ~send(2)~ are ignored because a closed socket causes
    ~select(2)~ to return immediately, and we notice it in the next
    iteration when calling ~recv(2)~.

  - This loop works well on Unix. You can pipe input in from a file:
    #+begin_example
    cat my_file.txt | tcp_client 192.168.54.122 8080
    #+end_example

- Explanation:
  + ~fd_set reads~: Set to monitor ~socket_peer~ for readability.
    - ~FD_ZERO(&reads)~: Clears the set.
    - ~FD_SET(socket_peer, &reads)~: Adds the socket.
    - ~FD_SET(0, &reads)~: Adds 0 for ~STDIN_FILENO~.
  + ~struct timeval timeout~: Sets 100ms timeout for ~select~.
  + ~select(socket_peer + 1, &reads, 0, 0, &timeout)~:
    - Monitors ~socket_peer~ for incoming data.
    - Errors: Prints ~errno~ and exits.
  + ~FD_ISSET(socket_peer, &reads)~ (first check):
    - If socket has data: ~recv()~ reads up to 4096 bytes.
    - ~bytes_received < 1~: Server closed connection; breaks loop.
    - Prints received data.
  + ~FD_ISSET(socket_peer, &reads)~ (second check):
    - Monitors ~STDIN_FILENO~ (0) for terminal input.
    - ~fgets(read, 4096, stdin)~: Reads user input.
    - ~send(socket_peer, read, strlen(read), 0)~: Sends input to server.
    - Prints bytes sent.
  + Purpose: Handles bidirectional communication with server.

** Close socket

#+name: close socket
#+begin_src C
  printf("Closing socket...\n");
  close(socket_peer);
  printf("Finished.\n");
#+end_src

* NEXT Compile and test TCP client

1) Tangle =tcp_client.c= (or download from: [[https://tinyurl.com/tcp-client-full][tinyurl.com/tcp-client-full]])

2) Build the complete program

   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     make tcp_client
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   : make: 'tcp_client' is up to date.

3) Test with ~example.com~ on port ~80~ (http): Run the client to connect
   to ~example.com~ on port ~http~ (port 80):
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     ./tcp_client example.com http
   #+end_src

4) Send an HTTP GET Request: After the client prints "Connected." and
   "To send data, enter text followed by enter.", type the following
   HTTP GET request (press Enter after each line, and twice after the
   last line):
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
   #+end_src
   - This sends a request to ~example.com~ to retrieve its homepage.

5) Expected Output: After sending the request
   #+begin_example
       Sending: GET / HTTP/1.1\n
       Sent 16 bytes.
       Sending: Host: example.com\n
       Sent 18 bytes.
       Sending: \n
       Sent 1 bytes.
       Received (... bytes): HTTP/1.1 200 OK...
       [HTML content from example.com]
   #+end_example

   - The client prints the server’s response, including HTTP headers
     and the webpage’s HTML.

   - Note: ~example.com~ may close the connection after responding:
     #+begin_example
     "Connection closed by peer.", "Closing socket...", "Finished.".
     #+end_example
 
6) Close connection with CTRL+D (EOF) to exit.

* TODO Building a full TCP server

- Now you could also build a multiplex server in the same way. In the
  illustration, the server's only service is to turn any input into
  upper case with the ~toupper~ function applied to the input sent from
  the client.
  #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:

  #+caption: Source: van Winkle (2020), p. 95.
  [[../img/server_output.png]]
    
* TODO Extensions: Chat Room

- Next, you can try and send data between two connected clients by
  modifying the TCP server program.

- Example: A chat room. Whatever you type in one of the TCP client
  terminals gets sent to all other connected terminals:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:

* TODO UDP client and server

- Do you know what the best way about a UDP joke is?
  #+begin_quote
  I don't care if you get it or not.
  #+end_quote

- For the client, the main difference is ~ai_socktype (~SOCK_DGRAM~), and
  that no reliable connection with the server is established.
  #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
  #+caption: Source: van Winkle (2020) p. 106
  [[../img/tcp_vs_udp.png]]

- For the server, only one socket is required that can communicate
  with any number of peers.

  #+caption: Source: van Winkle (2020) p. 107  
  [[../img/udp_server.png]]

* TODO TCP web client and web server

- We haven't built a web server or web client yet: All we've done is
  send and receive text over local and then remote network connections.

- For HTTP, more is required: The requests need to comply with the
  HTTP protocol (~GET~):
  #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
  #+caption: Source: van Winkle (2020) p.168.
  [[../img/http2.png]]

- The web resource itself is encoded as URL:
  #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
  [[../img/url2.png]]

- We need to write a C function to parse a given URL. That's not
  trivial - the final source code runs to 250 lines. Its core looks
  like this:
  #+begin_example C
void parse_url(char *url, char **hostname, char **port, char** path) {
    // Print the full input URL for debugging
    printf("URL: %s\n", url);
    char *p;
    // Look for the "://" delimiter to separate protocol from the rest
    p = strstr(url, "://");
    char *protocol = 0;
    if (p) {
        protocol = url; // Start of the protocol string
        *p = 0;         // Terminate the protocol string at ":"
        p += 3;         // Move pointer to the start of hostname
    } else {
        // If no protocol is found, assume the entire string is the rest of the URL
        p = url;
    }
    // If a protocol was specified, verify it's "http"
    if (protocol) {
        if (strcmp(protocol, "http")) {
            fprintf(stderr,
                    "Unknown protocol '%s'. Only 'http' is supported.\n",
                    protocol);
            exit(1); // Exit if protocol is unsupported
        }
    }
    // Start of the hostname
    *hostname = p;
    // Advance until we find a port delimiter (:), path (/), or fragment (#)
    while (*p && *p != ':' && *p != '/' && *p != '#') ++p;
    // Default HTTP port
    *port = "80";
    if (*p == ':') {
        *p++ = 0; // Null-terminate the hostname
        *port = p; // Start of the port string
    }
    // Move past the port number
    while (*p && *p != '/' && *p != '#') ++p;
    *path = p; // Temporarily set the path pointer
    if (*p == '/') {
        *path = p + 1; // Skip the '/' and point to the start of the path
    }
    *p = 0; // Null-terminate the port or path
    ++p;
    // Skip until the end of the string or a fragment delimiter
    while (*p && *p != '#') ++p;
    if (*p == '#') *p = 0; // Remove fragment if present
    // Debugging output
    printf("hostname: %s\n", *hostname);
    printf("port: %s\n", *port);
    printf("path: %s\n", *path);
}
  #+end_example

- How would this look like in Python? With the ~urllib~ library:
  #+begin_example python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def parse_url(url):
    print(f"URL: {url}")

    # Parse the URL using urlparse
    parsed = urlparse(url)

    # Check for protocol
    if parsed.scheme and parsed.scheme != 'http':
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown protocol '{parsed.scheme}'. Only 'http' is supported.")

    # Extract hostname
    hostname = parsed.hostname
    if not hostname:
        raise ValueError("Hostname could not be parsed.")

    # Extract port, use 80 if not provided
    port = parsed.port if parsed.port else 80

    # Extract path, skip the leading slash
    path = parsed.path[1:] if parsed.path.startswith('/') else parsed.path

    # Output for debugging
    print(f"hostname: {hostname}")
    print(f"port: {port}")
    print(f"path: {path}")

    return hostname, str(port), path
  #+end_example

- But without ~urllib~, the manual parsing is just as tedious though
  you don't have to juggle pointers (but you also have no control):
  #+begin_example python
def parse_url(url):
    print(f"URL: {url}")

    # Initialize default values
    protocol = None
    hostname = None
    port = "80"
    path = ""

    # Handle protocol
    if "://" in url:
        protocol, remainder = url.split("://", 1)
        if protocol != "http":
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown protocol '{protocol}'. Only 'http' is supported.")
    else:
        remainder = url  # Assume entire string is host/path/port

    # Find end of hostname
    host_end = len(remainder)
    for i, c in enumerate(remainder):
        if c in [':', '/', '#']:
            host_end = i
            break

    hostname = remainder[:host_end]
    remainder = remainder[host_end:]

    # Handle port if present
    if remainder.startswith(':'):
        remainder = remainder[1:]
        port_end = len(remainder)
        for i, c in enumerate(remainder):
            if c in ['/', '#']:
                port_end = i
                break
        port = remainder[:port_end]
        remainder = remainder[port_end:]

    # Handle path if present
    if remainder.startswith('/'):
        path_start = 1  # Skip the leading slash
    else:
        path_start = 0
    path_end = len(remainder)
    for i in range(path_start, len(remainder)):
        if remainder[i] == '#':
            path_end = i
            break
    path = remainder[path_start:path_end]

    # Output for debugging
    print(f"hostname: {hostname}")
    print(f"port: {port}")
    print(f"path: {path}")

    return hostname, port, path
  #+end_example
