* Objectives

The following topics are covered:

- [ ] Understanding the importance of sockets in network programming
- [ ] Understanding the client socket workflow
- [ ] Coding a TCP client socket
- [ ] Understanding the server socket workflow
- [ ] Coding a TCP server socket
- [ ] Connecting client and server over TCP
- [ ] Use of ~make~ to build applications

* Why sockets are important in network programming

- Sockets are the low level endpoint used for processing information
  across a network.

- Protocols like HTTP and FTP rely on sockets.

- Sockets are bidirectional so there isn't anything different about a
  "client" socket (on the client side) vs. a "server" socket on the
  server side.

* Client Socket Workflow

On the client side, three function calls are involved: we need to open
or create a ~socket~, ~connect~ to a remote IP address and a port, and
when the connection is accepted, we can receive data with ~recv~:

#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
+---------+
| socket()|
+---------+
     |
     v
+----------+
| connect()|
+----------+
     |
     v
+---------+
| recv()  |
+---------+
#+END_EXAMPLE

- The result of this call is stored in an integer =network_socket=, and
  this is the descriptor that we use to refer to the socket later on.
- We're going to use IP addresses (~AF_INET~) and TCP (~SOCK_STREAM~) as
  our protocol.
- Once the socket is created, we connected it to a remote address.
- If the connection is successful, we get a success signal back.
- Once we've received data, we can write it into a string and use it.

- The following function prototypes are involved:
  #+begin_src C :results none :noweb yes
    <<network header files>>

      // IPv4 or IPv6, TCP or UDP, protocol type)
    int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);

    // descriptor, ptr to destination address, length of address
    int connect(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);

    // descriptor, ptr to buffer, max no. of bytes, msg flags)
    ssize_t recv(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
  #+end_src

* Create TCP client socket

- Include standard header files:
  #+name: standard header files
  #+begin_src C :results none
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
  #+end_src

- Include several special header files
  #+name: network header files
  #+begin_src C :results none
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <sys/socket.h>
    #include <netinet/in.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
  #+end_src

- Main program:
  #+begin_src C :noweb yes :tangle ./src/tcp_client.c :includes :main no
    <<standard header files>>
    <<network header files>>

    #define PORT 9002
    int main(void)
    {
      // Redirect stderr to stdout
      dup2(1,2);
      
      // create a socket
      int network_socket;
      // Use IPv4, TCP, default protocol
      network_socket = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0);

      // specify an address for the socket
      struct sockaddr_in server_address;
      server_address.sin_family = AF_INET; // IPv4
      server_address.sin_port = htons(PORT); // Convert port number
      server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; // Use 0.0.0.0

      // connect to socket
      int connection_status =  // return 0 if ok, or -1
        connect(network_socket,
                (struct sockaddr *) &server_address,
                sizeof(server_address));
      // check for error with connection
      if (connection_status == -1) {
        perror("Connection error");
      }

      // receive some data from the server
      char server_response[250]; // empty string to hold data
      recv(network_socket,&server_response,sizeof(server_response),0);

      // print the data that we get back
      if (connection_status == 0) {
        printf("The server sent the data: %s",server_response);
      }

      // close the socket - unistd.h
      close(network_socket);
      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : Connection error: Connection refused

- To test, run this and you should get the output:
  #+begin_example
   Connection error: Connection refused.
  #+end_example

* Server Socket Workflow

On the server side, we also need to create a ~socket~ but then we need
to ~bind~ that socket to an IP address and port where it can ~listen~ for
connections, ~accept~ a connection, and either ~send~ or ~recv~ data to
those sockets it has connected to:

#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
+---------+
| socket()|
+---------+
     |
     v
+----------+
| bind()   |
+----------+
     |
     v
+---------+
| listen()|
+---------+
     |
     v
+---------+
| accept()|
+---------+
     |
     v
+---------+
| send()  |
+---------+
#+END_EXAMPLE

- The following additional function prototypes are involved:
  #+begin_src C :results none :noweb yesn
    <<network header files>>

    // descriptor, ptr to address, size of address
    int bind(int sockfd, const struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t addrlen);

    // descriptor, max no of pending connections that can be queried
    int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);

    // descriptor, ptr to storage for address, length of address
    int accept(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *addr, socklen_t *addrlen);

    // descriptor, ptr to the data to send, no of bytes to send, msg flags
    ssize_t send(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
  #+end_src

* Create TCP server socket

- We can reuse the header files from the client side program:
  #+begin_src C :noweb yes :tangle ./src/tcp_server.c :includes :main no
    <<standard header files>>
    <<network header files>>

    #define PORT 9002
    #define CONN 5
    int main(void)
    {
      // text sent to clients
      char server_message[250] = "You have reached the server!\n\n";

      // create socket
      int server_socket;
      server_socket = socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0);

      // define server address
      struct sockaddr_in server_address;
      server_address.sin_family = AF_INET;
      server_address.sin_port = htons(PORT);
      server_address.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY;

      // bind the socket to our specified IP and port
      bind(server_socket,
           (struct sockaddr*) &server_address,
           sizeof(server_address));

      // listen to the connection (max CONN)
      listen(server_socket, CONN);

      // accept connection with client
      int client_socket;
      client_socket = accept(server_socket,NULL,NULL); // local connection

      // send data (server message) to client
      send(client_socket, server_message, sizeof(server_message), 0);

      // close the socket
      close(server_socket);

      return 0;
    }
  #+end_src

* Connecting client and server over TCP

- *Setup:*
  1. Tangle the client source code (=tcp_client.c=)
  2. Tangle the server source code (=tcp_server.c=)
  3. Make a directory =./TCPclient= with ~mkdir -v~
  4. Make a directory =./TCPserver= with ~mkdir -v~
  5. Move client source code into =./TCPclient= with ~mv -v~
  6. Move server source code into =./TCPserver= with ~mv -v~
  7. Open *two* command-line windows and put them on top of one another

- *Demo:*
  1. In both windows, run ~ll~ to see the files.
  2. In both windows, run ~make~ to build the machine code.
  3. In both windows, run ~ll~ again to see the machine code.
  4. In =./TCPclient= run =tcp_client= to get the error message.
  5. In =./TCPserver= run =tcp_server &= to start the server.
  6. In =./TCPclient= run =tcp_client= again to get the server message.

- Why does =tcp_server= end after the client runs?
  #+begin_quote
  This TCP server is a one-shot server: after calling ~accept~ and
  sending the message, the server closes the socket and returns - the
  server process exits.
  #+end_quote

- Home assignment:
  #+begin_quote
  To keep the server open and handle multiple client requests
  (sequentially), you can wrap the ~accept~ and ~send~ part in an infinite
  loop, and add a loggint ~printf~ message to monitor activity.
  #+end_quote

* Summary Q & A

1. What is the role of a socket in network programming, and how do the
   ~socket()~ function parameters (domain, type, protocol) determine its
   behavior? Provide an example using the TCP client socket code from
   the lecture.
   #+begin_quote
   A socket is a low-level endpoint for sending and receiving data
   across a network, acting as the interface between an application
   and the network protocol stack. It enables communication for
   protocols like TCP or UDP.

   The ~socket()~ function parameters define its behavior: ~domain~ (e.g.,
   ~AF_INET~ for IPv4) specifies the address family, ~type~ (e.g.,
   ~SOCK_STREAM~ for TCP) sets the communication style, and ~protocol~
   (usually 0 for default) selects the specific protocol.

   In the lecture’s TCP client code, ~network_socket = socket(AF_INET,
   SOCK_STREAM, 0)~ creates a socket using IPv4, TCP, and the default
   protocol, allowing the client to connect to a server and receive
   data.
   #+end_quote

2. Compare the steps in the client socket workflow (~socket()~,
   ~connect()~, ~recv()~) with the server socket workflow (~socket()~,
   ~bind()~, ~listen()~, ~accept()~, ~send()~). Why does the server require
   additional steps like ~bind()~ and ~listen()~?
   #+begin_quote
   The client workflow starts with ~socket()~ to create a socket, uses
   ~connect()~ to initiate a connection to a server, and calls ~recv()~ to
   receive data.

   The server workflow also begins with ~socket()~ but then uses ~bind()~
   to associate the socket with a specific IP and port, ~listen()~ to
   prepare for incoming connections, ~accept()~ to establish a
   connection with a client, and ~send()~ to transmit data.

   The server needs ~bind()~ and ~listen()~ because it must be reachable
   at a known address and port, and it passively waits for client
   requests, unlike the client, which actively initiates
   communication.
   #+end_quote

3. Explain how the client and server establish a connection over TCP using the code examples provided. What does the ~htons(PORT)~ function do, and why is it necessary when setting up the ~sockaddr_in~ structure?
   #+begin_quote
   The client creates a socket with ~socket()~, sets the server’s
   address (IP and port) in a ~sockaddr_in~ structure, and uses
   ~connect()~ to request a connection.

   The server creates a socket, assigns it an IP and port with ~bind()~,
   calls ~listen()~ to wait for clients, and uses ~accept()~ to connect,
   creating a new socket for communication.

   The ~htons(PORT)~ function adjusts the port number (e.g., 9002) so
   it’s in the correct format for the network. It’s necessary because
   different computers might store numbers differently, and ~htons()~
   ensures the port is understood the same way by both client and
   server when filling the ~sockaddr_in~ structure.
   #+end_quote

4. In the client socket example, the program checks if
   ~connection_status == -1~ to detect a connection error. What might
   cause this error in a real-world scenario, and how could you modify
   the client code to provide more specific feedback about the
   failure?
   #+begin_quote
   A ~connection_status == -1~ indicates ~connect()~ failed, possibly due
   to the server not running, a wrong IP/port, network issues (e.g.,
   firewall blocking), or the server’s backlog being full. To improve
   feedback, include ~perror()~ or ~strerror(errno)~ after the
   check. Modified code: ~if (connection_status == -1) {
   perror("Connection error"); }~ This prints a detailed error message
   (e.g., "Connection refused" if the server isn’t listening), helping
   identify the specific issue rather than just "Connection error."
   #+end_quote

5. The lecture notes describe the TCP server as a "one-shot server"
   that exits after handling one client. How would you modify the
   server code to handle multiple client requests sequentially using
   an infinite loop? Include a sample code snippet with your
   explanation.
   #+begin_quote
   #+begin_quote
   The server exits after one client because ~accept()~ and ~send()~ run
   once, then ~close()~ is called. To handle multiple clients sequentially,
   wrap ~accept()~ and ~send()~ in an infinite loop. Sample modification:
   #+end_quote
   #+begin_example C
   while (1) {
     int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL,NULL);
     printf("Client connected\n");
     send(client_socket,server_message, sizeof(server_message), 0);
     close(client_socket); // Close client socket, not server_socket
   }
   #+end_example
