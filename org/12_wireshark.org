* Wireshark Setup Without Admin Rights

This guide helps you install and use Wireshark on Windows *without
needing administrator privileges*. You'll use it to analyze
pre-captured network traffic files (.pcap) provided.

You will not be able to capture live traffic, but you can analyze
existing captures just fine.*

*Step 1: Download and Install Wireshark*

1. Go to https://www.wireshark.org/download.html

2. Download the Windows installer for the latest stable version
   (64-bit).

3. Run the installer:
   - If prompted for admin access, choose "No" or "Cancel" and re-run
     the installer as a normal user.
   - *Uncheck* any options related to Npcap or live capture.
   - Make sure to keep the default options for the Wireshark GUI and
     TShark CLI.

*Step 2: Open a `.pcap` File*

You can find a .pcap (capture network traffic file) here:
https://tinyurl.com/wireshark-pcap-1

You can open them in two ways:

*Using the GUI:*
1. Open the Wireshark application.
2. Go to =File â†’ Open= and select the `.pcap` file.
3. Apply filters in the top filter bar (e.g., =http= or =ip.addr==192.168.1.10=).

*Using the Command Line (TShark):*
1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the folder where your `.pcap` file is saved.
3. Run:

   #+begin_src sh
     tshark -r example.pcap
   #+end_src

   You can also filter specific protocols, like this:

   #+begin_src sh
     tshark -r example.pcap -Y "http.request"
   #+end_src
