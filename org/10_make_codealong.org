- Based on ~makefiletutorial.com~

* Overview

- What is GNU ~make~? A tool that automatically builds executables and
  libraries from source code. Read the start of the ~make~ manual page.

- Heres is an example dependency graph that you can build with ~make~:
  If any of the file's dependencies change, the file will get
  recompiled.

  [[../img/dependency_graph.png]]

- Why use it?
  + Automates compilation
  + Avoids recompiling unchanged files
  + Makes builds faster and cleaner

- ~make~ works with configuration files called ~Makefile~. It consists of
  rules that reflect the dependencies and say what needs to be done.

- The ~Makefile~ consists of targets, prerequisites or dependencies, and
  rules that are applied when the dependencies are triggered.

* Simple example - "Hello, World"

- Create a file called =makehello= with this code in it. The rule in the
  second line *must be indented by a TAB* - type =C-q TAB= to do
  that. Then tangle the file with =C-u C-c C-v t=
  #+begin_src C :tangle makeHello :main no :includes
    hello:
    echo "Hello, World"
  #+end_src

- If the file =hello= does not exist, the command (which must be
  indented with a TAB) is executed.

- Since you're going to create and change different makefiles, it's
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    make -f makeHello # use `makeHello` as your makefile
    make -sf makeHello # execute in silent mode
  #+end_src

- What if the target (=hello=) does already exist?
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    touch hello # 1 create an empty file `hello`
    make -f makeHello  # 2 make `hello` with `make`
    if [ -f hello ]; then
        rm hello  # 3 remove `hello` if it exists
    fi
    make -sf makeHello  # 4 remake `hello` (silently)
  #+end_src

- *Explanation:*
  1. We create an empty file =hello= using the ~touch~ command.
  2. Running ~make~ now means that nothing is to be done.
  3. Then we remove the =hello= file.
  4. Now ~make~ can build the target.

- The other condition to build a target: The dependencies are more
  recent than the target. To test this, we need a ~makefile~ with a
  dependency.

- Let's add a dependency after the target, and ~touch~ it so that it is
  more recent than =hello=. First the configuration file =makehello2=:
  tangle it (=C-u C-c C-v t=):
  #+begin_src C :tangle makeHello2 :main no :includes
    hello: hello2
    echo "Hello, World"
  #+end_src

- Understand it: ~make~ finds the target =hello= but not the dependency
  =hello2=, and it cannot build it without a target and a rule to do so:
  #+begin_src bash :results silent :exports both
    make -f makeHello2
  #+end_src

- You should get an error message:
  #+begin_example
  make: *** No rule to make target 'hello2', needed by 'hello'.  Stop.
  #+end_example

- Remake the makefile: tangle the update (=makeHello3=)
  #+begin_src C :tangle makeHello3 :main no :includes
    hello: hello2
    echo "Hello, World"
    hello2:
    echo "hello2 is here now!"
  #+end_src

- Test it (remove =hello2= if it already exists):
  #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both
    if [ -f hello2 ]; then
        rm hello2  # remove `hello2` if it exists
    fi
    make -sf makeHello3
  #+end_src

* Making C files

1) To begin with, remove all =*blah*= files:
   #+begin_src bash :results output

   #+end_src

2) Tangle a file called ~blah.c~ that does nothing much (=C-u C-c C-v t=):

   #+begin_src C :main no :includes :tangle blah.c
     // blah.c
     int main() { return 0; }
   #+end_src

3) Create a makefile called =makeblah= (don't forget =C-q TAB=) that
   compiles =blah.c= into =blah=:
   #+begin_src :main no :includes :tangle makeblah


   #+end_src

4) Run ~make~ on =makeblah= (=C-c C-c=):
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both

   #+end_src

5) Explain this:
   #+begin_quote

   #+end_quote

6) When we change the timestamp of =blah.c=, ~make~ will not apply the
   rule again, because =blah= exists and there is no dependency:
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both

   #+end_src

7) The following ~makefile~ will run all three targets - tangle it:

   #+begin_src C :main no :includes :tangle makeblah2
   blah: blah.o
   	cc blah.o -o blah # runs third
   blah.o: blah.c
   	cc -c blah.c -o blah.o # runs second
   blah.c:
   	echo "int main() { return 0; }" > blah.c # runs first
   #+end_src

8) If you delete =blah.c=, all three targets will be rerun because the
   target is not found.
   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both

   #+end_src

9) You can use the =clean= target to create and delete =some_file=:
   #+begin_src C :main no :includes :tangle makeSome_file
   some_file:
   	touch some_file

   clean:
   	rm -f some_file
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src bash :results output :exports both

   #+end_src

* Variables

- Variables can only be strings. To assign values to them, you can use
  ~=~ or ~:=~ and whitespace is allowed (unlike in ~bash~).

- Example: =files= is a variable with two string values.
  #+begin_example makefile
files := file1 file2 # set to string "file1 file2"

some_file: $(files)
        echo "Look at this variable: " $(files)
        touch some_file # update timestamp

file1:
        touch file1

file2:
        touch file2

clean:
        rm -f file1 file2 some_file
  #+end_example

- Unlike ~bash~, ~make~ does not interpret quotes but views them as
  characters. You need them for commands like ~printf~:

  #+begin_example makefile
a := one two \n # set to the string "one two \n"

all:
        printf $a  
        printf '$a'
  #+end_example

- Reference variables use ~${}~ or ~$()~:
  #+begin_example makefile
x := dude

all:
        echo $x
        echo ${x}
        echo $(x)
  #+end_example

* Practice exercise

** Create a project structure

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output

#+END_SRC

** Create file: =main.c=

#+BEGIN_SRC c :tangle ./project/main.c
  #include <stdio.h>
  #include "math.h"

  int main() {
    printf("2 + 3 = %d\n", add(2, 3));
    return 0;
  }
#+END_SRC

** Create file: =math.c=

#+BEGIN_SRC c :tangle ./project/math.c
  int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
  }
#+END_SRC

** Create file: =math.h=

#+BEGIN_SRC c :tangle ./project/math.h
  int add(int a, int b);
#+END_SRC

** Write a Makefile with:

- Object file compilation
- Final linking
- Variables for =CC= and =CFLAGS=
- Use of ~.PHONY~ target

** Sample Makefile

- Create this ~Makefile~:
  #+BEGIN_src C :tangle ./project/makefile :main no :includes
CC = gcc
CFLAGS = -Wall

main: main.o math.o
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o main main.o math.o

main.o: main.c math.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c main.c

math.o: math.c math.h
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c math.c

.PHONY: clean
clean:
	rm -fv *.o main
  #+END_src

- ~CC~ is the compiler to use, ~CFLAGS~ are its options (all warnings).

- The first target =main= is the final executable. It links the object
  files. When it is found, the dependencies =main.o= and =math.o= must
  exist or they have to be made.

- The second target =main.o= is built from =main.c= and depends on =math.h=
  for the function declaration (prototype). The gcc flag ~-c~ compiles
  but does not link.

- The third target =math.o= is built from =math.c= and depends on =math.c=
  and the header file =math.h= which declares the math function.

- The ~.PHONY~ target is used to declare that a given target is not a
  file but rather a label for a command to run. This prevents ~make~
  from getting confused if a file with the same name as the target
  exists.

- Summary:

  | Target | Purpose                              | Trigger                          |
  |--------+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------|
  | main   | Links main.o, math.o into executable | .o file is newer than main       |
  | main.o | Compiles main.c                      | main.c or math.h changes         |
  | math.o | Compiles math.c                      | math.c or math.h changes         |
  | clean  | Utility to clean up build files      | Manual (invoked with make clean) |

- Test: Change to =project=, ~make~ everything.
  #+begin_src bash :results output

  #+end_src

- ~touch~ =main.o= and remake:
  #+begin_src bash :results output

  #+end_src  

- ~touch~ =main.c= and remake:
  #+begin_src bash :results output

  #+end_src  

- Clean up:
  #+begin_src bash :results output

  #+end_src
