* Practical TCP/IP Model Part 1: Bits, Frames, Packets, Segments

- TCP/IP model:
  1) Change PT mode to ~Simulation~ so that we can see packet traffic.
  2) When data is sent at the physical layer 1 - *bits* are sent.
  3) When data is sent at the data link layer 2 - *frames* are sent.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frames.png]]
  4) When data is sent over the network layer 3 - *packets* are sent.
  5) When data are transported via layer 4 - *segments* are sent.

- People tend to blame "the network" even if it's an application error
  (which is much more likely given that the network is the most
  established, best designed, and best tested system available).

* Practical TCP/IP Model Part 2: HTTP captures

- Switch to ~Simulation~ mode.
- Open the web browser on ~PC 0~.
- Connect to the server on ~10.1.1.100~.
- Packets should appear ~Inside PC 0~.
- Hover over them: they are labeled ~TCP/IP~ and ~ARP~.
  1. The ~ARP~ *packet* is a broadcast request: "Who has the MAC address
     associated with this IP address?" Click on next step.
  2. The PC sends a *frame* to ~Switch1~.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server.png]]
  3. Open the ~ARP~ Type in the simulation window to follow the path of
     the frame on layer 2.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server2.png]]
  4. Look at the PDU (Protocol Data Unit): The target MAC address is
     blank (packet has not reached the server yet).
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server3.png]]
  5. The next step flushes the broadcast ARP request to all connected
     hosts, identifying the correct host as ~Server1~. Both ~Server2~ and
     ~Router1~ drop the packet.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server4.png]]
  6. The PDU shows that the server connection received the frame, and
     the Outbound PDU Details show that ~Server1~ responds with its own
     MAC address (ending in =0086=).
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server5.png]]
  7. Now the PC knows the MAC address of the server and can
     communicate with it directly sending/receiving TCP *packets*.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server7.png]]
  8. Only now can the PC send an HTTP request. It is forwarded to
     ~Switch1~, received on interface ~G1/0/4~ and forwarded to ~G1/0/2~.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server8.png]]
  9. *How does the network know what to do at layer 3* (Network/Ethernet
     in the PDU) In the PDU, you now see an 'EtherType', =TYPE: 0x800=
     which means IPv4. This is how the payload is identified as an
     *IPv4 packet* and processed accordingly: When an application
     interacts with this data via sockets, it uses ~AF_INET~ to indicate
     IPv4 addressing.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/type.png]]
  10. *How does the network know what to do at layer 4*
      (Transport/TCP/IP in the PDU)? In the IANA (Internet Assigned
      Numbers Authority) registry for IP protocol numbers, ~0x06~
      corresponds to TCP so the IP's packet payload is a *TCP
      segment*. Find IPv4 protocol nos. on the [[Concrete example:][IANA registry site]].

- How does the layer 3 ~TYPE~ information relate to sockets?
  1) An Ethernet frame with ~TYPE 0x0800~ arrives
  2) The kernel's network stack strips the Ethernet header and hands
     the IPv4 packet to the IP layer.
  3) A server program (e.g. a web server) listening on a socket
     created with ~socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0)~ receives the data if
     it's destined for that port.

- How does the layer 4 ~PRO~ information relate to sockets?
  1) Recall the ~socket~ prototype definition:
     #+begin_example C
     int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
     #+end_example
  2) The TCP value from the IP header is implicitly linked through the
     stack: When you create a socket with
     #+begin_example C
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)
     #+end_example
     - ~AF_INET~ says you're using IPv4
     - ~SOCK_STREAM~ says you want a reliable stream (TCP)
     - ~0~ means "use default for this domain and type", which is TCP.

- Example: When a packet arrives with ~PRO:0x06~
  1) The IP layer (3) hands it to the TCP layer (4).
  2) The TCP layer matches it to an existing socket based on the
     4-tuple: (source IP, source port, dest IP, dest port) from the
     TCP header
  3) Data now become available to an application via the socket
     operation ~read~.
  4) When an application sends data through a ~SOCK_STREAM~ socket, the
     stack builds a TCP segment, wraps it in an IP packet with the
     protocol field set to ~0x06~ and sends it out.

* Practical TCP/IP Model Part 2: Port Numbers

- Check out PDU details (TCP): The *Destination Port* is *:80*, while the
  *Source Port* is *:1025*.

- Google "port numbers" and go to the =iana.org= site. Then search for
  the port number 80. You find *Tim Berners-Lee* next to it as the
  maintainer of this register entry.

- The port number is responsible for sending the data to the right
  application (e.g. an HTTP web service). The HTTP server only listens
  on port 80 (unless you instructed it otherwise).

- Different ports are used for HTTP on the server side: 80 for plain
  HTTP, and 443 for (encrypted) HTTPS.

- The source port (1025) is an ephemeral (or dynamic) port chosen
  temporarily for convenience on the client side (the PC). Different
  sessions can operate in parallel on different ports.

- From the IANA page: There are
  1) System ports (0-1023)
  2) User ports (1024-49151)
  3) Dynamic/Private/Ephemeral ports (49152-65535)

- Different operating systems, however, use different ranges. Windows
  specifically allows you to customize ports from 1025 upwards.

- The port number is represented by a 16-bit field in the packet
  header, hence 2^16 = 65,536 possible numbers in [0,65535].

- Know the well-known protocols: FTP (21), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) etc.

* Restart simulation

1) Make an HTTP request from PC0 to =10.1.1.100= (Server1)
2) Move the simulation forward until the the HTTP message has reached
   the server. Check =Sequence number= and =Acknowledgement= PDU entries.
3) Move past the HTTP request until you get a sequence of several TCP
   requests (this may take a while).

This is the situation we're trying to clear up: Why do the hosts keep
exchanging TCP segments after the HTTP request is finished?

* Why does TCP keep sending segments after HTTP requests

- Context: HTTP handles the application-level request/response (e.g.,
  ="GET /index.html"= and the HTML content), TCP ensures reliable
  delivery. This reliability generates additional TCP segments beyond
  the HTTP payload.

- To see the following, you can open the PDU / OSI Model view.

- We'll first go through the simulation, then we'll look at the
  analysis.

** TCP Connection Establishment (3-Way Handshake)

Before HTTP data moves, TCP establishes a connection:

- *SYN*: Client sends a TCP segment with the SYN flag to the server
  (e.g., port 80).

- *SYN-ACK*: Server responds with SYN and ACK flags, agreeing and
  acknowledging.

- *ACK*: Client sends an ACK to confirm, completing the handshake.

  These appear as TCP segments *before* the HTTP request in Packet
  Tracer. Post-HTTP traffic builds on this.

** HTTP Request and Response

Once connected:

- Client sends an HTTP GET request (e.g., "GET /index.html
  HTTP/1.1") in one or more TCP segments.

- Server replies with the HTTP response (e.g., "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
  plus content), split across segments if needed.

  In Packet Tracer, these are TCP segments carrying HTTP
  payloads. Small pages fit in one; larger ones fragment. TCP’s work
  continues after this.

** TCP Acknowledgments (Reliability)

TCP ensures every segment is received:

- Server sends a data segment; client sends a TCP segment with ACK
  (e.g., "I got bytes 1–1460").
- For multi-segment responses, this repeats: data, ACK, data, ACK.

  In Packet Tracer, ACKs appear as standalone TCP segments (no HTTP
  data, just headers). This back-and-forth is TCP confirming
  delivery.

** TCP Connection Teardown (4-Way Handshake)

After the page is delivered, TCP closes the connection:

- *FIN*: Server (or client) sends a TCP segment with FIN, signaling it’s
  done.
- *ACK*: Other side ACKs the FIN.
- *FIN*: Second side sends its FIN.
- *ACK*: First side ACKs, closing the connection.

In Packet Tracer, this is four TCP segments post-HTTP. Server often
initiates closure (e.g., HTTP/1.0), but timing varies.

** HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive (Optional)

With HTTP/1.1 keep-alive, the TCP connection stays open for potential
follow-ups (e.g., images):

- Idle TCP segments (e.g., keep-alive probes, window updates).

- Extra HTTP requests/responses for embedded resources.

Packet Tracer might simplify this, but multi-resource pages increase
TCP traffic.

** Why This Happens in Packet Tracer

Packet Tracer simulates the full TCP/IP stack. For example:

- Client requests `index.html`.
- Server sends it in 2 segments (1460 bytes each).
- Client ACKs each.
- Server sends FIN, client ACKs, client sends FIN, server ACKs.

  That’s at least 6 post-request TCP segments.

** Summary

Post-HTTP TCP segments are likely:
1. *ACKs* for response data.
2. *FIN/ACK sequence* for closure.
3. Possibly *window updates* or retransmissions (check sequence
   numbers).

TCP segments persist after HTTP because TCP confirms delivery (ACKs)
and negotiates closure (FINs). It’s TCP, not HTTP, driving the extra
traffic.

* Checking Flags and Sequence/Acknowledgment Numbers in Packet Tracer

In Packet Tracer, the Flags field in the TCP header (PDU) is shown as
a hexadecimal value with a breakdown:

- Common flag values:
  + ~0x02~ = SYN (start connection) - Seq = 0, Ack = 0.
  + ~0x10~ = ACK (acknowledge data or prior segment) - Seq = 1, Ack = 1.
  + ~0x01~ = FIN (end connection).
  + ~0x12~ = SYN+ACK (handshake response) - Seq = 0, Ack = 1.
  + ~0x11~ = FIN+ACK (combined finish and acknowledgment).

These numbers help TCP manage data flow:

- *Sequence Number*: Tracks the sender’s data stream. Starts at a random
  value (e.g., 0 or 12345) and increments by the bytes sent.

- *Acknowledgment Number*: Confirms receipt. If the client gets a
  segment with Sequence 0 and 1460 bytes, it sends Ack 1460 (expecting
  the next byte).

- Example:
  + Server sends data: ~Seq: 0, Len: 1460, Flags: 0x18 (PSH+ACK)~.
  + Client replies: ~Seq: 1, Ack: 1460, Flags: 0x10 (ACK)~.

* Closing a TCP connection: 4-way handshake

- To close the TCP connection and stop seeing more HTTP traffic, you
  need to change the server settings from "Keep-Alive"
  (persistent).

- This is not available in our version of PT - you can only switch
  HTTP off or change the =Global Algorithm Settings= in =Config=.

- When the connection is closed:

  1. The server sends a TCP segment with the FIN flag set (=0x01=)
  2. The host responds with an ACK (=0x10=), then sends its own FIN
     followed by a final ACK.

- This is a 4-way handshake:
  1) Server → PC: FIN
  2) PC → Server: ACK
  3) PC → Server: FIN
  4) Server → PC: ACK

* A failed HTTP request

1) Open Cisco Packet Tracer.
2) Open =TCP_IP_OSI_Model.pkt.=
3) Switch to ~Simulation~ mode.
8) Open =10.1.1.99= in a browser on PC0.
9) Check the =TCP= PDU.
   #+begin_quote
   1. The device receives a TCP RST+ACK segment on the connection to
      10.1.1.99 on port 80.
   2. Received segment information: the sequence number 0, the ACK
      number 1, and the data length 20.
   3. The TCP segment has the expected peer sequence number.
   4. The TCP connection was refused.
   5. The device sets the connection state to CLOSED.
   #+end_quote
10) What just happened?

What just happened:
#+begin_quote
- The PC receives a TCP segment with both RST (reset) and ACK
  (acknowledgement) flag set from the IP 10.1.1.99:80 (HTTP).
- RST means: connection is forcibly terminated.
- ACK acknowledges the prior segment (SYN from 3-way handshake).
- PDU:
  - Sequence number 0, ACK number 1
  - Data length 20: TCP header with no payload (minimum size)
- In a real network, you might get an ICMP "Destination unreachable"
  message instead (Packet Tracer simplifies it).
#+end_quote

- The TCP-level connection includes a control phase (handshake) and a
  data transfer (payload) if the handshake is successful.

* TODO Network application requirements
#+attr_html: :width 700px :float nil: 
#+caption: Kurose/Ross, Computer Networking (2017) p. 121.
[[../img/loss.png]]

- *Data loss*: Can the app tolerate data loss (can packets be dropped
  during transmission)? /Loss-tolerance/ = that some packets can be
  interpolated or ignored as long as the data stream continues.

- *Throughput*: How much data need to be transferred over the network?
  /Elastic/ = app can adapt to flexible bandwidth. Transfer can pause or
  resume. /Specific:/ Consistent data rate per sec required.

- *Time-Sensitive*: Is the application sensitive to delays (latency) in
  data delivery? If *No*, then delays are fine. If *Yes*, then delays can
  be tolerated within limits (e.g. 100-500 ms). *Yes and no*:
  Time-sensitive for real-time chats, delays for non-urgent messages.

All of these affect the choice of protocol. E.g. TCP ensures no loss
by retransmitting dropped packets but adds delay, and enables veriable
flow control (does not guarantee bandwidth - UDP does).

* TODO Packet Loss Recovery in TCP/IP

When a packet is dropped (lost) under TCP/IP, TCP ensures recovery
because it’s a reliable protocol, unlike UDP. This process uses
sequence numbers, acknowledgments (ACKs), and retransmission. Here’s
how it works.

** How Packet Loss Happens

Packets can be lost due to:
- Network congestion (e.g., router buffers overflow).
- Physical errors (e.g., cable noise).
- Routing issues (e.g., temporary blackout).
- Firewall or QoS policies discarding packets.  When lost, the sender
  doesn’t get confirmation, triggering TCP’s recovery.

** TCP’s Recovery Process

*** 1. Detection of Loss

TCP detects loss in two ways:

1. *Timeout (Retransmission Timeout - RTO)*:
   - Sender sets a timer per segment based on *Round-Trip Time (RTT)*.
   - If no ACK arrives before timeout, the packet (or its ACK) is
     assumed lost.
   - RTT is calculated dynamically (e.g., [[https://tcpcc.systemsapproach.org/algorithm.html][Jacobson’s algorithm]]).

2. *Duplicate ACKs (Fast Retransmit)*:
   - Each segment has a *Sequence Number* for its byte offset.
   - Receiver ACKs the next expected sequence. If a packet’s lost, it
     sends duplicate ACKs for the last good segment.
   - Three duplicate ACKs signal loss to the sender.
     Example:
     - Sender: Seq 1000 (1460 bytes), Seq 2460, Seq 3920.
     - Seq 1000 arrives, ACK 2460 sent.
     - Seq 2460 lost, Seq 3920 arrives, ACK 2460 repeated.
     - Three ACKs 2460 → loss detected.

*** 2. Retransmission

Once detected:

1. *Timeout Case*:
   - Sender retransmits the unacknowledged segment (e.g., Seq 2460).
   - Timer resets, sending often slows.

2. *Fast Retransmit Case*:
   - After three duplicate ACKs, sender retransmits immediately (e.g.,
     Seq 2460).
   - Faster than waiting for timeout: Retransmitted segment is
     identical—same sequence, same data.

*** 3. Receiver Handling

- Receiver reorders packets using sequence numbers (e.g., Seq 3920
  before 2460).
- On retransmitted Seq 2460 arrival, sends cumulative ACK (e.g., ACK
  5380).
- Discards duplicates silently if retransmitted unnecessarily.

*** 4. Congestion Control (Avoiding More Loss)

Loss often means congestion, so TCP adjusts:
- *Slow Start*: Post-timeout, halves *congestion window (cwnd)*, restarts
  small.
- *Congestion Avoidance*: Post-fast retransmit, reduces cwnd (e.g.,
  half), moderates pace.
- *Timer Backoff*: Doubles timer per retry (exponential backoff).
  Balances recovery with network stability.

** Example in Action

- Sender: Seq 1000, Seq 2460, Seq 3920 (cwnd = 3 segments).
- Seq 2460 drops.
- Receiver: ACK 2460 (after Seq 1000), ACK 2460 (after Seq 3920).
- Sender: Three ACKs 2460 → retransmits Seq 2460.
- Receiver: Gets Seq 2460, sends ACK 5380.
- Sender adjusts cwnd, continues if more data.

** Key Mechanisms at Play

- *Sequence Numbers*: Track bytes, detect gaps.
- *ACKs*: Feedback, trigger retransmission.
- *Timers*: Catch loss without feedback.
- *Congestion Window*: Balances recovery and network load.

** Recovery Success

TCP recovers unless the connection fails entirely (e.g., network
partition). Sender retries (up to 5–15 attempts) before quitting, then
the application (e.g., browser) sees an error.

** TODO Home assignment: TCP Packet Loss Recovery ([[https://lyon.instructure.com/courses/3114/assignments/43202][Canvas]])

This exercise helps you explore how TCP recovers from packet loss in a
simulated network using Cisco Packet Tracer. You’ll set up a basic
network, send data, drop a packet, and observe TCP’s recovery process.

The exercise was designed with the help of Grok 3 after a lot of back
and forth with me alongside the development of the "TCP/IP deep dive"
lecture and practice exercises.

Grok's confidence that it will work as described is 85%-90% (based on
a careful breakdown). I would like you to try it and report back if
you encounter any issues. I will do it myself of course and then we
can compare notes.

*You get the points for this exercise for trying even if you do not
succeed (but you must document your failure).*

* TODO Email protocols: SMTP, POP3, IMAP

** POP3

  - Post Office Protocol version 3
  - Retrieves emails from a server to a local client
  - Downloads emails and usually deletes them from the server (unless
    configured otherwise)
  - Best for offline access, not great for syncing across devices

** IMAP

  - Internet Message Access Protocol
  - Keeps emails on the server, syncs them with your device
  - Syncs changes (read, delete, etc.) across multiple devices
  - Ideal for multi-device use, requires internet connection

** SMTP

  - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
  - Handles sending emails from your client to the recipient’s server
  - Complements POP3 and IMAP: SMTP sends, POP3/IMAP receive

** Key Differences

  - POP3: Downloads emails (one-way), no sync
  - IMAP: Syncs emails (two-way), server-based
  - SMTP: Sends emails, doesn’t receive

* TODO Practical TCP/IP Model Part 3: E-mail capture

- Close the web server and open the E-mail application on the PC.

- Compose an E-mail to =peter@cisco.com=

- Check on the server for the E-mail service

- Go back to the E-mail and write "test email" in the =Subject= and in
  the editor field, write "test e-mail showing port numbers".

- Switch on simulation mode.

- Click send in the PC0 editor.

- Click "Play" in the simulation dashboard.

- Check =Inbound Details= in the PDU for the first =TCP= segment:
  1) ~TYPE~ shows =0x0800= for IPv4 on Ethernet layer 2 (data-link)
  2) ~PRO~ shows =0x00= for TCP on IP layer 3 (network)
  3) ~DESTINATION PORT~ shows =PORT 25= on TCP layer 4 (transport)
  4) ~SMTP Data~ (Simple Mail Transfer) on layer 7 (application)

- Once the email has been received from the server, you can see it in
  the =Receive= field of your email client. If you open the inbound
  details, you'll find the message data and
