* Practical TCP/IP Model Part 1: Bits, Frames, Packets, Segments

- TCP/IP model:
  1) Change PT mode to ~Simulation~ so that we can see packet traffic.
  2) When data is sent at the physical layer 1 - *bits* are sent.
  3) When data is sent at the data link layer 2 - *frames* are sent.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frames.png]]
  4) When data is sent over the network layer 3 - *packets* are sent.
  5) When data are transported via layer 4 - *segments* are sent.

- People tend to blame "the network" even if it's an application error
  (which is much more likely given that the network is the most
  established, best designed, and best tested system available).

* Practical TCP/IP Model Part 2: HTTP captures

- Switch to ~Simulation~ mode.
- Open the web browser on ~PC 0~.
- Connect to the server on ~10.1.1.100~.
- Packets should appear ~Inside PC 0~.
- Hover over them: they are labeled ~TCP/IP~ and ~ARP~.
  1. The ~ARP~ *packet* is a broadcast request: "Who has the MAC address
     associated with this IP address?" Click on next step.
  2. The PC sends a *frame* to ~Switch1~.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server.png]]
  3. Open the ~ARP~ Type in the simulation window to follow the path of
     the frame on layer 2.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server2.png]]
  4. Look at the PDU (Protocol Data Unit): The target MAC address is
     blank (packet has not reached the server yet).
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server3.png]]
  5. The next step flushes the broadcast ARP request to all connected
     hosts, identifying the correct host as ~Server1~. Both ~Server2~ and
     ~Router1~ drop the packet.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server4.png]]
  6. The PDU shows that the server connection received the frame, and
     the Outbound PDU Details show that ~Server1~ responds with its own
     MAC address (ending in =0086=).
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server5.png]]
  7. Now the PC knows the MAC address of the server and can
     communicate with it directly sending/receiving TCP *packets*.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server7.png]]
  8. Only now can the PC send an HTTP request. It is forwarded to
     ~Switch1~, received on interface ~G1/0/4~ and forwarded to ~G1/0/2~.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/frame2server8.png]]
  9. *How does the network know what to do at layer 3* (Network/Ethernet
     in the PDU) In the PDU, you now see an 'EtherType', =TYPE: 0x800=
     which means IPv4. This is how the payload is identified as an
     *IPv4 packet* and processed accordingly: When an application
     interacts with this data via sockets, it uses ~AF_INET~ to indicate
     IPv4 addressing.
     #+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
     [[../img/type.png]]
  10. *How does the network know what to do at layer 4*
      (Transport/TCP/IP in the PDU)? In the IANA (Internet Assigned
      Numbers Authority) registry for IP protocol numbers, ~0x06~
      corresponds to TCP so the IP's packet payload is a *TCP
      segment*. Find IPv4 protocol nos. on the [[Concrete example:][IANA registry site]].

- How does the layer 3 ~TYPE~ information relate to sockets?
  1) An Ethernet frame with ~TYPE 0x0800~ arrives
  2) The kernel's network stack strips the Ethernet header and hands
     the IPv4 packet to the IP layer.
  3) A server program (e.g. a web server) listening on a socket
     created with ~socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0)~ receives the data if
     it's destined for that port.

- How does the layer 4 ~PRO~ information relate to sockets?
  1) Recall the ~socket~ prototype definition:
     #+begin_example C
     int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
     #+end_example
  2) The TCP value from the IP header is implicitly linked through the
     stack: When you create a socket with
     #+begin_example C
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)
     #+end_example
     - ~AF_INET~ says you're using IPv4
     - ~SOCK_STREAM~ says you want a reliable stream (TCP)
     - ~0~ means "use default for this domain and type", which is TCP.

- Example: When a packet arrives with ~PRO:0x06~
  1) The IP layer (3) hands it to the TCP layer (4).
  2) The TCP layer matches it to an existing socket based on the
     4-tuple: (source IP, source port, dest IP, dest port) from the
     TCP header
  3) Data now become available to an application via the socket
     operation ~read~.
  4) When an application sends data through a ~SOCK_STREAM~ socket, the
     stack builds a TCP segment, wraps it in an IP packet with the
     protocol field set to ~0x06~ and sends it out.

* Practical TCP/IP Model Part 2: Port Numbers

- Check out PDU details (TCP): The *Destination Port* is *:80*, while the
  *Source Port* is *:1025*.

- Google "port numbers" and go to the =iana.org= site. Then search for
  the port number 80. You find *Tim Berners-Lee* next to it as the
  maintainer of this register entry.

- The port number is responsible for sending the data to the right
  application (e.g. an HTTP web service). The HTTP server only listens
  on port 80 (unless you instructed it otherwise).

- Different ports are used for HTTP on the server side: 80 for plain
  HTTP, and 443 for (encrypted) HTTPS.

- The source port (1025) is an ephemeral (or dynamic) port chosen
  temporarily for convenience on the client side (the PC). Different
  sessions can operate in parallel on different ports.

- From the IANA page: There are
  1) System ports (0-1023)
  2) User ports (1024-49151)
  3) Dynamic/Private/Ephemeral ports (49152-65535)

- Different operating systems, however, use different ranges. Windows
  specifically allows you to customize ports from 1025 upwards.

- The port number is represented by a 16-bit field in the packet
  header, hence 2^16 = 65,536 possible numbers in [0,65535].

- Know the well-known protocols: FTP (21), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443) etc.

* NEXT Why does TCP keep sending segments after HTTP requests

In Cisco Packet Tracer, after an HTTP request (e.g., fetching a web
page) is exchanged between a PC (client) and server, you observe TCP
segments continuing to flow back and forth. This reflects TCP’s role
as a reliable, connection-oriented protocol beneath HTTP. Let’s break
it down.

- Context: HTTP Over TCP HTTP (e.g., requesting a web page) runs on
  TCP. While HTTP handles the application-level request/response
  (e.g., "GET /index.html" and the HTML content), TCP ensures reliable
  delivery. This reliability generates additional TCP segments beyond
  the HTTP payload.

  In Packet Tracer, you see the full TCP lifecycle—connection setup,
  data transfer, and teardown—plus HTTP nuances.

** 1. TCP Connection Establishment (3-Way Handshake)

Before HTTP data moves, TCP establishes a connection:

- *SYN*: Client sends a TCP segment with the SYN flag to the server
  (e.g., port 80).
- *SYN-ACK*: Server responds with SYN and ACK flags, agreeing and
  acknowledging.
- *ACK*: Client sends an ACK to confirm, completing the handshake.

  These appear as TCP segments *before* the HTTP request in Packet
  Tracer. Post-HTTP traffic builds on this.

** 2. HTTP Request and Response

Once connected:

- Client sends an HTTP GET request (e.g., "GET /index.html
  HTTP/1.1") in one or more TCP segments.
- Server replies with the HTTP response (e.g., "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
  plus content), split across segments if needed.

  In Packet Tracer, these are TCP segments carrying HTTP
  payloads. Small pages fit in one; larger ones fragment. TCP’s work
  continues after this.

** 3. TCP Acknowledgments (Reliability)

TCP ensures every segment is received:

- Server sends a data segment; client sends a TCP segment with ACK
  (e.g., "I got bytes 1–1460").
- For multi-segment responses, this repeats: data, ACK, data, ACK.

  In Packet Tracer, ACKs appear as standalone TCP segments (no HTTP
  data, just headers). This back-and-forth is TCP confirming
  delivery.

** 4. TCP Connection Teardown (4-Way Handshake)

After the page is delivered, TCP closes the connection:

- *FIN*: Server (or client) sends a TCP segment with FIN, signaling it’s
  done.
- *ACK*: Other side ACKs the FIN.
- *FIN*: Second side sends its FIN.
- *ACK*: First side ACKs, closing the connection.

  In Packet Tracer, this is four TCP segments post-HTTP. Server often
  initiates closure (e.g., HTTP/1.0), but timing varies.

** 5. HTTP/1.1 Keep-Alive (Optional)

With HTTP/1.1 keep-alive, the TCP connection stays open for potential
follow-ups (e.g., images):

- Idle TCP segments (e.g., keep-alive probes, window updates).

- Extra HTTP requests/responses for embedded resources.

Packet Tracer might simplify this, but multi-resource pages increase
TCP traffic.

** Why This Happens in Packet Tracer

Packet Tracer simulates the full TCP/IP stack:

- *Realism*: Shows TCP’s reliability (ACKs) and session management (FINs).

- *Learning Focus*: Exposes low-level TCP for education.

- *Simplification*: May streamline (e.g., no pipelining).

Example:
- Client requests `index.html`.
- Server sends it in 2 segments (1460 bytes each).
- Client ACKs each.
- Server sends FIN, client ACKs, client sends FIN, server ACKs.

  That’s at least 6 post-request TCP segments.

** Conclusion

Post-HTTP TCP segments are likely:
1. *ACKs* for response data.
2. *FIN/ACK sequence* for closure.
3. Possibly *window updates* or retransmissions (check sequence
   numbers).

To confirm in Packet Tracer:
- Use *Simulation Mode*.
- Filter TCP packets between PC and server.
- Check *Flags* (SYN, ACK, FIN) and *Sequence/Acknowledgment Numbers*.

Example PDU view:
#+begin_example
TCP:
  Source Port: 1025
  Destination Port: 80
  Sequence Number: 0
  Acknowledgment Number: 0
  Flags: 0x02 (SYN)
#+end_example

** Summary

TCP segments persist after HTTP because TCP confirms delivery (ACKs)
and negotiates closure (FINs). Packet Tracer exposes this to teach
networking. It’s TCP, not HTTP, driving the extra traffic.

* Checking Flags and Sequence/Acknowledgment Numbers in Packet Tracer

In Packet Tracer, the Flags field in the TCP header is shown as a
hexadecimal value with a breakdown:

- Common flag values:
  + ~0x02~ = SYN (start connection).
  + ~0x10~ = ACK (acknowledge data or prior segment).
  + ~0x01~ = FIN (end connection).
  + ~0x12~ = SYN+ACK (handshake response).
  + ~0x11~ = FIN+ACK (combined finish and acknowledgment).

These numbers help TCP manage data flow:

- *Sequence Number*: Tracks the sender’s data stream. Starts at a random
  value (e.g., 0 or 12345) and increments by the bytes sent.

- *Acknowledgment Number*: Confirms receipt. If the client gets a
  segment with Sequence 0 and 1460 bytes, it sends Ack 1460 (expecting
  the next byte).

- Example:
  + Server sends data: ~Seq: 0, Len: 1460, Flags: 0x18 (PSH+ACK)~.
  + Client replies: ~Seq: 1, Ack: 1460, Flags: 0x10 (ACK)~.

* Practical TCP/IP Model Part 3: E-mail and FTP captures

- Close the web server and open the E-mail application on the PC.

- Compose an E-mail to =peter@cisco.com=

- Check on the server for the E-mail service

- Go back to the E-mail and write "test email" in the =Subject= and in
  the editor field, write "test e-mail showing port numbers".

- Switch on simulation mode.

- Click send and watch what happens.

- Check =Inbound Details= in the PDU:
  1) ~TYPE~ shows =0x0800= for IPv4 on Ethernet layer 2
  2) ~PRO~ shows =0x00= for TCP on IP layer 3
  3) ~DESTINATION PORT~ shows =PORT 25= on TCP layer 4
  4) ~SMTP Data~ (Simple Mail Transfer) on application layer 7

- Once the email has been received from the server, you can see it in
  the =Receive= field of your email client. If you open the inbound
  details, you'll find 

- Home assignment: FTP transfer (details forthcoming).
