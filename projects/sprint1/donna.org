Analyzing Crisis Communication of the 2025 California Fires via Twitter APIs

By intergrating communication, networking, and data visualization techniques,
this project aims to provide insights into the effectivness of social media
information distribution during disasters. 

The findings could help emergency management services refine their
communication strategies and enhance public response effortsin future crises.

* DONE Problem Description:

Analyze the speed and distribution of vital information during
emergencies, identifying key amplifiers and their role in 
spreading critical updates.

* DONE Reason:
** 1. Identifying Twitter accounts that are fast and reliable.

    a. Knowing where to turn for updates during a crisis is 
       crucial for first responders, California residents,
       and the family members of those in danger.

** 2. Quick and accurate information saves lives,

    By helping emergency teams and residents
    understand where the danger is and how to
    respond effectively.

    a. The Califorina wildfire were intensified
       by 80mph winds, which rapidly spread 
       embers all across the state.

    b. The extreme conditions made it 
       challenging to coordinate evacuations
       and stretched first responders thin.
    
** 3. Understanding who controls the flow of infromation is crucial.  
    
    a. The entities that shape public perception during 
       emergencies may have underlying motives, influencing the
       response to the crisis and the safety of those affected.

    b. Those in control of information can spread false or 
       misleading narratives, leading to confusion, panic, or
       delayed emergency responses.
    
    c. Information may be selectively presented to align with
       political, economic, or ideological interests rather than
       prioritizing public safety.

    d. When people recognize that information is being
       manipulated, they may lose trust in even credible sources,
       increasing the risk of ignoring life-saving guidance in
       critical situations.
 
* DONE Constraints:
** 1. Knowledge and Technical Restraints
*** a. Limited Experience with APIs
      - No prior experience working with APIs, 
        meaning I will need to learn how to authenticate,
        request, and handle responses from Twitter's APIs.
*** b. No Experience with Named Entity Recognition (NER)
      - Extracting and analyzing entities
        (Ex.locations, organizations, people) from 
        tweets is unfamiliar territory,
        meaning there wll be extra learning will be
        for NER tools like spacy textTinyR (R).
*** c. R is my most familiar language
     - It would be preferable to use R  libraries like
       rtweet(for Twitter API), tidytext (for text analysis),
       igraph (for network analysis), and ggplot 
       (for visualizations). 
** 2. Personal Restraints
*** a. Time Constraints
      - I am a full-time student with a work-study job,
      learning new skills takes extra time.
*** b. Best Programming Language is R 
      - Might face challenges if documentation and 
        tutorials are more Python-focused.
*** c. Large Scale data
      - May take longer to process and visualize
        large datasets efficiently.
*** d. Limited Access
      - Twitter Free API Limits (2025)

        1.Tweet Retrieval: 1 request per 15-minute 
                           window (recent tweets only).


        2. Tweet Posting: Max 1,500 tweets per month
                          (application level).
 
        3. Historical Data: Limited to recent tweets 
                            (typically past 7 days only).

        4. Rate Limits: Strict limits on API calls;
                        exceeding them results in a 
                        429 "Too Many Requests" error.

        5. Limited Endpoints: No access to certain endpoints 
                             (e.x., detailed engagement metrics,
                              user mentions).

        6. Monthly Tweet Cap: Up to 500,000 tweets per month 
                              from search and stream endpoints.

        7. Authentication: Uses OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token 
                           (limits apply at the application level).

        8. No Access to Premium Features: Advanced filters, full archive search,
                                          and additional analytics require a paid
                                          tier.

* DONE Goals:[0/4]

 1. [ ] Create a Network Graph:
        a. Visualizes how tweets, retweets, and 
           mentions connect users and spread
           information.
        b. Identifies key influencers driving the
           spread of information.
       
 2. [ ] Conduct Anaylsis and Visualizations:
          
        a. Heap Map
           - Visualize fires
           - Show where fire-related tweets originate
             and how the discussion spreads 
             geographically.

        b. Histogram
           - Show engagement levels vary across
             different tweets. (Tweets and likes
              
        c. Time-Series
           - Show how fast wildfire-related tweets 
             increase over time.                    


 3. [ ] Scrape Twitter to collect tweets referencing
	  the Califorina fires.

 4. [ ] Apply Named Entity Recongnition (NER) to 
        extract key entities such as locations, 
        emergency agencies, and crisis related
        keywords.

** 4. Impact & Practical Usefulness
   a. Being able to demonstrate how information spread patterns can 
      help first responders identify trusted sources faster.

   b. Highlighting key accounts people should follow during future 
      California crises for reliable updates.

* Questions I Had and Topics To Research:
** What is Webscraping? 
Data scraping is the process of using a program to extract data
from a website and save it in a structured format.

 - This is what a general DIY web scraping process looks like:

   1. Identify the target website.

   2. Collect URLs of the target pages.

   3. Make a request to these URLs to get the HTML of the page.

   4. Use locators to find the information in the HTML.

   5. Save the data in a JSON or CSV file or some other structured format.

** What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?
NER is a task of natural language processing, which identifies and
tags entities within a text. These entities can be people, dates,
companies, or locations. 
 - Rstats has several great packages for natural language
   processing, including openNLP and spacyr.
