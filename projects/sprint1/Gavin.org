* Topic

- I wanted to use the network to sync a game between to
  pcs.


* Proposal

** Problem Description:

- I want to create a simple multiplayer game and sync it
  on both ends with fair accuracy.


** Reason:

- I want to create games in the future and this would be a
  decent start.


** Constraints:

- I have to figure out how I could develop a simple
  pingpong game.

- I have to learn how to sync two games over a network.

- Time could be an issue when ever I get a part time
  job.

- How can it be downloaded on multiple machines without going
  through proper sources like google play, steam, ect.


** Goals:

- True Goals:

  -- Successfully sync two games over a network.

  -- Learn a little about game development.

- NonGoals:

  -- create an amazing game.


** Metrics:

- I could try to figure out packet loss and ping during live tests
  to determine success.

- I could base success off of lag on both ends without ping and packet loss (are players lagging
  all over the place?)


** References:

- I used ChatGPT to get this idea.
